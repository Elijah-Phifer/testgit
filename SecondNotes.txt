CSS
is not a programming language, it is a STYLING LANGUAGE

it is used for modifiying the apperence of the content of the website
used for presentation

There are multiple ways to use css - creativity centered

syntax:
selector: many different types; css styles start with a selector to apply the
style too (h1)

property-value pairs = defines a property and the value for the property 
(color: blue;)

Template:

selector {
	property1: value;
	property2: value;
}

Basic example of syntax:

h1 {
	color: blue;
}
^^^ *Sets the text color of all h1 elements to blue* ^^^

CSS Selector:

Main Types:

Element: Applys style to all HTML elements of what ever type to notate

Class: One of the most useful; Lets you select HTML elements based on their class
atribute; all elements can have atributes attached to them; class atributes are
used with CSS to distingush elements for specific styling. The class atribute
can have multiple different classes in the same atribute as long as they're
seperated by a space.

Inorder to select an element by class:

.class-name {
	property: value;
}
*A period tells CSS that what ever follows is a class name.

Example:
If you want to make three similar buttons but they all have different colors,

Define the base class:

.btn {
	padding: 10px;
	color: white;
}

and then add seperate styles to the seperate classes that "inherit" from the 
base class

.btn-1 { backgrouond-color: green; }
.btn-2 { backgrouond-color: blue; }
.btn-3 { backgrouond-color: purple; }

Then just add the base button class and the seperate color-specific button classes
to your HTML button elements

*In HTML*

<button class="btn btn-1">
	button 1
</button>
<button class="btn btn-2">
	button 2
</button>
<button class="btn btn-3">
	button 3
</button>

^^*In HTML*^^

ID: similar to class (it is and HTML atribute) but there can only be one ID
in an element and it should be unique across the entire webpage

*In HTML*

<h1 id="main-header">
	Title
</h1>
^^*In HTML*^^

*In CSS*
Template:

#id {
	property: value;
}
^^*In CSS*^^

CSS selector combinations

.selector-1.selector-2 {
	property: value;
}

Says that the item must have both selectors in order to inherit a style

.ancestor .child {
	property: value:
}

*notice the space between ancestor and child*

Example:
div p {
	color: red;
}

*Selects all p-tags in the div sections*

.big, .large {
	font-size: 200%
}

*allows you to use the same property-value style for different atributes*

* {
	font-family: Arial;
}

*selects all elements on entire web page*

How to load CSS into HTML:

Inline style: CSS writen in an HTML element *worst*
Style element: Using the HTML element <style></style> and writing the css in the 
element block

External CSS: Having a seperate CSS file and link to it from the HTML; using the
empty <link> element and a rel(relationship) atribute to define the relationship 
(in this case stylesheet) of the link to the HTML. The link is put afterwords
in a href(Hypertext Reference) atribute

Example:

<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
</head>
